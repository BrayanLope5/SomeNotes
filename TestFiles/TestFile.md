Can I create numbered lists:
1. This is an item.
2. This is another item.
    1. This is a sub-item.
    2. Yet another sub-item.
    3. Last sub.
3. I should add the next main item before adding sub-items. Makes it easier to add following items.
4. Next main-item.
    * Lets use this as a sub-item.
    * It works.
    - [x] This also works.
    - [ ] And of course this.
    - [ ] And this.
    - [ ]
